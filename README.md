Plumage
=======

Plumage is a theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) 3.2, a static site generator written in Python.

I initially created this theme for [my blog](http://kevin.deldycke.com), but now the theme is supposed to be generic enough to have its own repository.


Features
--------

  * Based on Twitter Bootstrap
  * Tags grouped by tiers
  * External assets (Bootstrap, Jquery, etc...) uses CDN
  * YouTube links


Plugins
-------

Plumage has built-in support for the following plugins:

  * [`neighbors`](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/neighbors)


Variables
---------

Plumage add new variables:

  * `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_DOMAIN`: add support for the `_setDomainName` variable in GA JS code.

And support other standards variables:

  * `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS`


TODO
----

  * Hack google search to integrate search result within theme design ?
  * Replace Google custom search by https://swiftype.com/ ? Or better, static search: http://ralsina.com.ar/weblog/posts/standalone-search-in-nikola.html
  * Fix embedded video aspect-ratio. Maybe the following may help:
      * https://github.com/toddmotto/fluidvids
      * https://github.com/chriscoyier/Fluid-Width-Video
  * Use a big carousel for front-page articles (ex: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples/carousel.html ) + a bit of http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/ to keep aspect-ratio
  * Check some web-dev essentials: http://webdevchecklist.com/
  * Add a fancy zoom for images
  * Use custom jinja filters instead of heavy tag soup in my theme ? Example: https://bitbucket.org/sirex/blog/src/32c192ff7a10/pelican.conf.py#cl-53
  * Add progressive image loading. See: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
  * Concatenate and minify CSS and Javascript. See:
      * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mincss
      * http://ralsina.com.ar/weblog/posts/mincss-is-amazing.html
      * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pelican-minify
  * Inline and embed all CSS in the page ? See: http://www.peterbe.com/plog/100-percent-inline-css
  * Use LESS version of bootstrap for cleaner customizations ?
  * Check and fix style on mobile (especially ugly margins)
  * Look at app-template for code inspiration and ideas:
      *  https://github.com/nprapps/app-template/blob/master/templates/_base.html
      *  https://github.com/nprapps/app-template/blob/master/render_utils.py
  * Add progressive loading on masonery layouts. See: http://masonry.desandro.com/demos/infinite-scroll.html
  * Contibute theme to Pelican's repository ? For the moment I have 2 fans:
      * https://twitter.com/_alagappan/status/328299060815618048
      * https://twitter.com/Jonas_Wallin/status/346373684912599040
  * Remove hard-coded Ad
  * Remove hard-coded header avatar
  * Re-integrate Related Posts: the Disqus widget doesn't do a good job. Use: https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/related_posts
  * Make footer content dynamic
